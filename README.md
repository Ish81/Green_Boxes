# 🟢 DSA & CP Problem Solving Log

## 🤓 Why I'm Doing This

Let's be honest — one reason I'm doing this is for those beautiful **green contribution boxes** on GitHub 😄.

But beyond the boxes, this daily habit serves multiple goals:

- 🧠 **Sharpen my DSA & Competitive Programming skills** through consistency  
- 🏗️ **Build a useful log** of all problems I've solved for easy revision  
- 📂 **Maintain a clean, organized repository** with solutions and notes  
- 🧑‍💻 **Showcase my discipline and growth** as a developer

Whether it's LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, or random mock questions — this is my journey log.
